<h3 align="center">COVID-19 PROJECT</h3>

## Introduction
<div style="text-align:justify">
In the current era of big data, a huge amount of data has been generated and collected from a wide variety of rich data sources. Embedded in these big data are useful information and valuable knowledge. An example is healthcare and epidemiological data such as data related to patients who suffered from epidemic diseases like the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Knowledge discovered from these epidemiological data helps researchers, epidemiologists and policy makers to get a better understanding of the disease, which may inspire them to come up ways to detect, control and combat the disease.

## Technologies
- To implement the website, we used HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript to build the website. This ensures a user-friendly interface and provides a robust foundation for the integration of dynamic elements. To bring our visualizations to life, we utilized the D3.js library.
## Data Visualization:
- To visualize the narrative of the global pandemic, we used map chart and line chart, which is complemented by interactive features for dynamic exploration of additional information and time lapse to enhance the presentation of time series data. Focusing the aim of our visualization towards policymakers, officials, and the general public, we prioritized the use of effective marks and channels that are easily understandable, even for those without a background in the subject. 
- For a comprehensive portrayal of global data, we opted for a map chart with a varying color scale. This visualization method aims to communicate a visual representation of the number of new COVID cases and vaccine coverage across different countries. The map chart is used in combination with the time lapse feature to add a temporal dimension. At each point in time, the color of the country changes to correspond to the fluctuations of COVID-19 cases and increase in vaccine coverage. 
## Achieved goals
- The primary aim of this project is to create a user-friendly and informative dashboard, offering valuable insights from complex raw data that is often challenging to access. Our goal is to practically apply theoretical concepts learned in class by incorporating charts and interactive features.
- Furthermore, by achieving these objectives, we aspire to deliver a groundbreaking dashboard that empowers users to delve into the depths of otherwise inaccessible insights within raw data. The interactive nature of the dashboard enables users to dynamically explore and analyze data, facilitating the extraction of meaningful knowledge and the formulation of informed strategies. Armed with these insights, users can make well-informed decisions, fostering success in their respective fields.
